Install 7Zip or another archive manager; unpack the simplescalar3.0 tar file

Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (preferably with Debian) or use a Linux OS.

Install the "make" and "gcc" packages using the Linux terminal

Open the Linux terminal within the simplescalar3.0 folder, or change the terminal directory to that folder

run "make config-pisa" and then "make" (make config-alpha changes to alpha configuration instead, not sure what the difference is)

There are several sim- executables to run; sim-outorder is the most complex simulator, we will be using this one to have access to the most features.

To run the executable, run "./sim-outorder <file path>" in the Linux terminal

"./sim-outorder ./tests-pisa/bin.little/test-math" runs the sim-outorder benchmarks for the test-math sample executable


After changing and/or replacing the sim-outorder.c file, the make commands will have to be run again before testing the executable.
